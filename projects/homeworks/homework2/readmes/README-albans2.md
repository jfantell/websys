> Question 1

The advantages to writing a jQuery plugin over regular JavaScript that uses jQuery is its ability to add structure to your code. It also affects your scope by making it less likely for a conflict to occur because all the code is contained within the plugin. jQuery plugins also make it easier to move code around, and they can be easily integrated into other projects without taking a lot of time. Therefore, they can be used more than once in different ways or environments. jQuery is also great for making sites more interactive, and therefore a good choice for using in our game.

> Question 2

We coded almost everything using our jQuery plugin, so that it is simply the output of a single id in HTML. This promotes the advantage of jQuery (discussed above) on how it is portable, meaning we could use this plugin we created easily on another site or game. Our markup is also clean and readable, which allows our jQuery to interact almost seamlessly. We also ensured our jQuery was separate from that of our markup so that it would begin only once the DOM has finished loading (avoids slowing down the page).


> Question 3

In order to post a high score to a server on different domain, we would need to consider the security implications and know that cross domain POSTing won't work on mobile browsers, so someone playing the game on their phone wouldn't be able to have their high score posted/be able to see it. 


    Observation
For this HW, we used the free in-browser editor for google drive https://codeyourcloud.com/ to write the majority of our code. Though at first we thought it was a great tool to use, we ran into a couple issues with code not being saved/not being able to see revisions made and by whom. It also only allowed for us to write in one language at a time, so we did everything through an HTML doc. I'm sure I can speak for the tema when I say that we would have benefited more by using Git. Now we know for next time, and certainly for our term project.
