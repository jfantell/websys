Our entire game was coded into a single HTML document (the CSS and Javascript was in there instead of being linked to externally).  This helped for us to all work on it together using a Google Drive extension called "Code Your Cloud". 

The vast majority of our actual HTML code was in our javascript. We figured its better to have it all in javascript, so that for a plugin it would be a one line id in any HTML document; so you could just imbed the entire game to a website whenever you wanted.
