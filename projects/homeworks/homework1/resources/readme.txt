ORIGINAL VERSION OF ASSIGNMENT. THE UPDATED VERSION IS BEING HOSTED AT ./websys/resume.html!


John Fantell

1. I used HTML5 to create my resume. According to W3Schools "HTML5 is not based on SGML, and therefore does not require a reference to a DTD" which is why I just typed <!DOCTYPE html>.
2. Unlike other versions of HTML, HTML5 does not require a reference to a DTD because it is not explicitly based on SGML
3. I did use divs and spans for stylistic purposes. Divs to create new block elements, and spans to stylize some inline text (such as the GPAs).
4. The hCard is very easily to understand as all of the classes have names that make it very easy to understand what they are referring to.

Note: For work experience I divided the three items up. My Viacom Service Desk position is directly listed under the "Work Experience" category. I put the undergratuate research project I am doing with the Lally School under Project Experience, and the Executive Board under Leadership Experience.
