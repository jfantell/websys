Lab 4: John Fantell

I grabbed all of the song elements (title, album, artist, etc) from the JSON file and for each song 
	1.) added each element to a string called "output"
	2.) inserted the content of the string into a class called ".asong", which I encapsulated in another class called "song" for formatting purposes
	3.) encapsulated all of the songs in the id "#playlist"

Additionally:
I tried to preserve the overall feel of lab 2, but I did change the class sturcture so that it is more semantically friendly.

Overall:
I was able to sharpen up my AJAX skills in this lab which is good since my term project will use lots of AJAX!!!!
