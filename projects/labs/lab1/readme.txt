I enjoyed this assignment. Before hand, I did not know what a Virtual Host was. Now I do.

You may notice that the details in the PHP configuration file (saved as a PDF) do not match the details in the PHP configuration snapshot (saved as PNG image). The reason for this is that I completed the lab last week on my Mac. On Tuesday, Mac OS Siera came out. :) After upgrading my OS, all of the files configured for the lab had been erased and  home brew is currently not supported with the new OS. That said, I went ahead and re-did the lab on a Windows 10 Virtual Machine via Parallels Desktop and everything is working again.
