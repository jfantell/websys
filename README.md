LAB 7
====================================================================================================================================

I designed two new HTML documents for Lab 7. That is "index.html" (completely replaces the "index.html" document created for Quiz 1) and "projects.html" which contains links to all of the labs and homeworks done throughout the semester. 

index.html
===========

-Uses one-page scrolling bootstrap template (https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-scrolling-nav/)
-The "Contact Me" should be fully functional; uses PDO to insert a user's name, email, and message into a SQL database

projects.html
==============

-Uses one-page scrolling bootstrap template (https://blackrockdigital.github.io/startbootstrap-scrolling-nav/)
-Uses Accordion JQuery widget featured at http://jqueryui.com/accordion/. All of the homework/lab data is inputted into the Accordion dynamically using AJAX.

overall organization
=====================

-All main pages use the navigation menu stored in the index_resources folder.
-All main page resources are stored in the respective page's resource folder located in the resources directory
-Various Bootsrap resources are used throughout the website. Most of these are stored in the bootsrap_resources folder, located in the resources directory
-The organization of labs and homework assignments is the same as it was for Quiz 1

final note
======================

I started development on my personal website (intended to be a portfilio showcasing the IT projects I have done throughout my time at RPI) around the same time this lab was announced. This assignment gave me the perfect opportunity to accelerate development on my site, so I put a lot of time into it. Lots of fun overall!
